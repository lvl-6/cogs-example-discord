## Cogs-example

I made this to practice using Discord.py's "Cogs" feature, so that I can make my bots modular and good.

This is useful for bots which will include a lot of different, complex sets of features, and I think that by
using Cogs and Extensions you will also be able to modify your bot's code and see the outcome without
restarting the bot, which is one of the things I love about Python.
